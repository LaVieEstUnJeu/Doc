The `doc` folder contains the external documentations of the projects.
Most of them were homeworks required by the "Epitech Innovative Projects" laboratory.

All the documents are available both in French and English.

These documents are formatted using LaTeX and compiled in PDF.
We use a template (available in the `doc/template` folder) to homogenize the graphics of our documents.
