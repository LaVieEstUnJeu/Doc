Documents
=========

## Documents types

Our documents are stored in different formats:

###### PDF documents generated from LaTeX

These documents are in [the Doc repository](https://github.com/LaVieEstUnJeu/Doc).
If you need to compile them, just type `make` on the server, and it's going to
use the template.

###### Google Drive documents

Some of the documents that are written by several people at the same time are
in our [Google Drive folder](http://goo.gl/mOrlk1).

###### Repositories documentation

Documentation for developers that are specific to a part of the project are
directly in the Github repositories, in the README files.

###### Auto-generated documentation

Some documentation are automatically generated from the comments in the code.

Lots of documents we wrote were homeworks required by the LabEIP for Epitech.
Since we're not updating them, most of them are __deprecated__.
