Documents
=========

##### Documents types

Our documents are stored in different formats:

###### PDF documents generated from LaTeX

These documents are in [the Doc repository](https://github.com/LaVieEstUnJeu/Doc).
If you need to compile them, just type `make` on the server, and it's going to
use the template.

###### Google Drive documents

Some of the documents that are written by several people at the same time are
in our [Google Drive folder](http://goo.gl/mOrlk1).

###### Repositories documentation

Documentation for developers that are specific to a part of the project are
directly in the Github repositories, in the README files.

Some documentation are automatically generated from the comments in the code.
